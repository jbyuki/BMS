# BMS

BMS (Be-Music Source) is a file format for rythmn actions games, devised by Urao Yane in 1998. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be-Music_Source).

This project is a player for BMS files.
It was made for learning purposes, no other purposes.

The source is written in C++ using SDL2 libraries.
I use a text processing tool called (letangle) to assist me when writing code.
Letangle files are \*.t files and generated \*.cpp \*.h can also be found in the repository.
